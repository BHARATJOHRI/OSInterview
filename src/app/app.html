  <div class="qa-card">
    <div class="question">❓ What is an Operating System?</div>
    <div class="answer">
      An Operating System (OS) is system software that manages computer
      hardware and software resources. It acts as an interface between
      user and hardware. The OS handles processes, memory, files, and
      devices. Examples include Windows, Linux, and macOS.
    </div>
  </div>
